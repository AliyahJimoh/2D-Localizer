\section{Problem Statement}
Mobile robots can be used to travel certain terrain or complete difficult tasks that could jeopardize the safety of the operators. Using sensors to let the robot know where it is, make it actively react or change its trajectory can help ensure the safty of the robot itself.
\subsection{Problem}
With environments that are closed space or indoors, it would be hard to get a GPS signal to locate the robot or see if the task has been completed. Testing the robot's trajectory and and algorithm in the actual site without having any way to truely replicate it can add the risk of the robot malfunctioning or having errors making ehic could make it difficult for retriving. This project aims to develop a 2-D localization simulator capable of showing the robot's trajectory while also keeping track of their coordinates through the sensors' placements in the simulation. 
% Pls Edit Below
This project will also draw inpiration from a library called GTSAM which has set up different examples based on SLAM.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

% \wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
% Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}
\subsubsection{Inputs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Room size  
    \item "April Tag" and sensor coordinates
    \item Wheel odometry for the robot
    \item Predicted Trajectory of robot
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Outputs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Estimated location of robot through sensors
    \item Estimated location through "April Tags"  
\end{itemize}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}
