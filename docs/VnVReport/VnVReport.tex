\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

This section is not applicable.

\section{Unit Testing}

The unit tests for \progname~are run using the command \texttt{make\ test} which executes the program \texttt{unit\_tests.py} located in the test folder. The script looks through all the programs that start with `test\_' and end with `.py' as that is the naming convention that was chosen for all test cases. 

After all the tests finish running, the program generates a .txt summary file each module tested. This file records whether the test passed or failed and indicates the location where the result is stored. A combined terminal output also provides a quick summary of the results.

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

% \wss{This section should highlight how feedback from the users and from 
% the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular 
% the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users) 
% should be highlighted.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Improved Accuracy Validation:} The approach for evaluating pose accuracy was expanded. The final version includes explicit tests for Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and Cram√©r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), validated in \texttt{test\_accuracy.py}.

  \item \textbf{Expanded Unit Testing and Coverage:} Initial versions of the VnV Plan lacked specific testing for key modules such as plotting and input validation. These were added in \texttt{test\_visuals.py} and \texttt{test\_inputs.py}, respectively.

  \item \textbf{Integration with Automation Tools:} To support repeatable testing, automated testing was introduced through an extra command in the Makefile to output summaries. This ensures that changes to the codebase can be quickly validated after updates.
\end{itemize}

\section{Automated Testing}

All unit and system tests were written using the \texttt{pytest} framework. Test scripts followed a consistent \texttt{test\_*.py} naming convention and were validated using both standalone runs and automated workflows. This custom Python script, \texttt{unit\_tests.py}, automatically discovers all test files and records their output in corresponding \texttt{.txt} summary files the \href{https://github.com/AliyahJimoh/2D-Localizer/tree/main/test/results}{test/results} folder in the GitHub Repository.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or
  a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.) \cite{Barfoot2017}
